# Urban Landscape and Nature

Creating Voronoi maps based on different points in a country (in this case, Switzerland). We start from a simple set of points of interest (POIs).
For the begining, we got help from [this Medium post](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-create-voronoi-regions-with-geospatial-data-in-python-adbb6c5f2134). 


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

We used

```
numpy
geopandas
contextily
matplotlib
shapely
geovoronoi
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running TODO

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

Once the env is set up, we can start by running the voronoi-pois notebook.






## Built With

* [geopandas](https://geopandas.org/) - Library for geoprocessing
* [geovoronoi](https://github.com/WZBSocialScienceCenter/geovoronoi) - For the plots
* [SWISSS SHAPES](https://shop.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/products/landscape/boundaries3D) - Used to generate Swiss boundaries
